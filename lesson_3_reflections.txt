When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you want to access your repository from different devices or locations
- When you want multiple users to have access to the repository
- As a backup of your repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Other users might have made changes to the remote repository that you do not wish to pull to your local branch until you are ready.
