When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you want to access your repository from different devices or locations
- When you want multiple users to have access to the repository
- As a backup of your repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Other users might have made changes to the remote repository that you do not wish to pull to your local branch until you are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Branches are the distinct chains of commits within repositories.
-Clones are copies of an entire repositories that have no direct link to the original repository.
-Forks are like clones within the Github server, but they retain a lnk to the original repository
-One would use a clone when one wanted to take a copy of a repository.  
-Forking would be used to keep a record of where the original repository came from.
