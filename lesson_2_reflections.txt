		What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git creates the hidden folder where the git commit istory and other info will be stored.
- This is necessary as you wouldn't want a repository in every folder, only where you need to ustilise git version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is a middle-ground between the working directory and the repository.  It allows us to assemble versions and their changes before committing.	

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- The git diff --staged command compares the files in the staging area to the last commit.
