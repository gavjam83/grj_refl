How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- It eliminated most of the matching lines.
- Removing the clutter made focusing easier; it also made finding the error much faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- Speed.  Much faster to compare current code to previous versions, and see what causes different behaviour.
- Allows reversion to previous versions should anything go wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
-Con: you might forget to commit or make a poor decision re commit point.
-Pro: Avoids having too many versions
-Pro: Commits are logical and distinct.
-Pro: Commit message makes searching history more effective and efficient.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Google docs versions are mostly for backups.  Git commits allow a more tailored version control.
- Being designed with coding in mind, Git accommodates multi file commits which are useful when updating code for multi flie programs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- git log shows all commits with details including time, comments and a commit uid
- git log -stat shows the same but lets you know exactly which files in the repository were changed on each commit
- git diff allows one to use the commit uid to compare two commits and shows the difference in terms of lines added and lines missing

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- Having version control means that one can always revert to a previous 'working' version should any changes break the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- I'd like to be able to use git for version control on my own small coding projects.
